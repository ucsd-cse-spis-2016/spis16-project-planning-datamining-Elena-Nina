We could find a correlation between people who like curry and people who like dogs.
THIS IS THE ONE vvvv WE HAVE IT!!!!
or..y'know...fricken...something that has to do with jokes. Like the amount you are predicted to like a joke.
Like what kind of jokes do you like!! Like you are most likely to laugh at this type of joke. So one person puts in a joke, and
it calculates the percentage of likeliness of you laughing at it.

Steps to identify how funny a word/phrase is:
1. Scrape joke site for joke content and rating.
2. Order all jokes in terms of highest rating to lowest rating.
3. For all jokes in between 7.5-10, find the most used words.
